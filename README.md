This a data binning algorithm that takes user data in the form (x,y,z) from file UserData.csv, organizes the data into prescribed bins, then 
attempts to interpolate and fill in empty bins in the data, then plots the data on a surface plot and other various forms. this is the same
code used in NusseltFunofAngleRen.py from HeatFluxSensors repo

The .CSV file can be made to be any set of x,y,z data, but the heading of x,y,z has to be retained.
